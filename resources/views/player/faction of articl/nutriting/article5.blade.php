         <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
         <p class="preview-text">
          Mycoprotein is derived from the filamentous fungus Fusarium venenatum, first discovered in the 1960s. Mycoprotein is high in protein and fiber and low in energy and saturated fat and contains no trans-fat or cholesterol. A systematic search of the PubMed identified 13 human studies investigating the health properties of mycoprotein, with some evidence of sustained satiety, improved metabolic profiling, and muscular protein synthetic response that warrants ongoing investigation. Mycoprotein is produced commercially, with low environmental impact, and is used as an ingredient in products marketed under the Quorn trademark.

         <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
         <p class="preview-text"> 
          Mycoprotein first emerged in the early 1960s when the British Industrialist Lord Rank sought to find a new safe and alternative source of protein that could be used to offset the global food crisis fueled by population growth.1 By 1967, Lord Rank and the Rank Hovis McDougall group had tested more than 3000 soil organism samples from across the world and identified Fusarium venenatum from a garden in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, in the United Kingdom.1 It was discovered that this aerobic microfungus could convert carbohydrate into protein—a process that could be applied on a larger scale to produce food-grade protein, today known as mycoprotein (Figure 1). Mycoprotein was approved for sale by the UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food in 1985 and is now produced by Marlow Foods in three 150 000-L fermenters each capable of producing ca. 2 tonnes per hour of mycoprotein.2 In its first stage of production, F venenatum is grown in an aerobic fermentation system using carbohydrate and nutrient substrates required for growth.3 The mycelium of the fungus is then heat-treated to reduce the ribonucleic acid content to approved levels. Once the ribonucleic acid levels are reduced, the suspended hyphae are centrifuged and recovered and the supernatant contains mycoprotein.4 Steaming, chilling, and freezing processes during the final stages of production give mycoprotein a meat-like structure similar to chicken when observed under a microscope (Figure 2). Table 1 compares the nutritional composition of mycoprotein and Quorn mince, which is around 88% mycoprotein by weight.

        <h4>NUTRITIONAL PERSPECTIVES
        </h4>

        <p class="preview-text"> 
          In accordance with European Commission, nutrition claims that can be made for mycoprotein are as follows: (1) “high in protein,” that is, at least 20% of the energy value of the food is provided by protein; (2) “low in fat,” that is, contains no more than 3 g of fat per 100 g of solids; (3) “low in saturated fat,” that is, does not contain more than 1.5 g of saturated fatty acids per 100 g of solids; and (4) “high in fiber,” that is, contains at least 6 g of fiber per 100 g.16,17 It should, however, be noted that regulations vary among countries, and in US regulations, “high” means 20% of the Daily Value per reference amounts customarily consumed (RACC).18 Mycoprotein is an important provider of dietary fiber, containing around 5 g per RACC. Because the Daily Value for fiber in the United States is 25 g, mycoprotein would therefore meet the US standard for the claim of “high” in fiber.

          As seen in Table 2, using US data for RACC19 and from the US Department of Agricutlure Food Composition Database,20 the nutritional profiles of plant- and animal-based food sources can be compared. Mycoprotein is lower in energy than some nonanimal protein sources. Protein levels in mycoprotein are similar to that of cooked chicken. With respect to protein, it should be noted that approximately 8% to 10% of the protein analyzed is nonprotein nitrogen. When looking at the RACC, mycoprotein has one of the lowest total fat and saturated fat profiles—providing less than 1 g of saturated fat per portion. It is also free from cholesterol and trans-fats.
          
          As shown in Figure 3, mycoprotein is an important source of fiber. The dietary fiber present in mycoprotein is naturally occurring, and typically one-third of this is chitin (poly n-acetyl glucosamine) and two-thirds is β-glucan.21 Linear β-glucans (from cereals) and branched β-glucans (fungi; yeast) have been shown to have immunostimulating effects and participate in physiological processes related to the metabolism of fats in the human body.22,23 Using the RACC and US Department of Agricutlure Food Composition Database data, it seems that mycoprotein contains more fiber than almonds, black beans, chickpeas, and peanuts do. However, it should be considered that the fiber foods between these food substances vary, with nuts and legumes contributing important nondigestible carbohydrates and lignin that are intrinsic and intact in plants.          
          </p>


        <h4>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION</h4>
        <p class="preview-text"> 
          
          In conclusion, mycoprotein has been growing in popularity internationally for over 5 decades. It has been on the market since 1985 and has a long-standing reputation of being safe, with its allergencity risks being no higher than that of some other protein sources. This innovative protein source can be consumed by nonmeat consumers, as well as those looking to keep their meat intakes aligned within dietary guidelines. Its low energy, low fat, and high fiber profile makes it an ideal healthy protein source. Emerging evidence also indicates wider benefits from mycoprotein consumption, including potential satiety and metabolic and muscular benefits. Healthcare professionals should be interested in advocating the use of mycoprotein within American diets.          </p>
