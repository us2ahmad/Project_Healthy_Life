         <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
         <p class="preview-text">
          Against the background of an ongoing international debate concerning the relationship between intellectual property rights, innovation and public health, in international organizations and more generally among governments and civil society organizations, the World Health Assembly decided in May 2003 to give an independent Commission the task of analysing this key issue.

The World Health Organization considered that its mission demanded it should play a part in this debate, with the objective of illuminating how intellectual property rights might affect public health. There was the need for governments in the north and  south, pharmaceutical companies, scientists and other stakeholders to consider how diseases which disproportionately affect developing countries could best be addressed, and to seek solutions
Our terms of reference made it clear that the focus of our enquiry should be the development of new diagnostics, vaccines and medicines to treat these diseases. But we quickly concluded that innovation was pointless in the absence of favourable conditions for poor people in developing countries to access existing, as well as new, products. The price of medicines is an important factor in determining access, but so also are poverty and the lack of infrastructure for delivering health care to poor people. It is not just neglected diseases, but rather neglected people, that should be  our main concern.

         <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
         <p class="preview-text"> 
          The world faces a fundamental dilemma. In recent years there has been a rapid increase globally in technological and economic potential, implying an enhanced ability to overcome problems related to poverty and poor health. But there has also been an actual deterioration in health status in many developing countries, largely as a result of HIV/AIDS but also because of a resurgence in other infectious diseases and a growing burden of noncommunicable diseases.

In the past 25 years, scientific and technological changes have accelerated. Just 25 years ago, the personal computer was in its infancy, as was the biotechnology industry. Genomics barely existed. The advances in biotechnology, underpinned and enabled by the parallel revolution in digital information technologies and the Internet, have opened up enormous opportunities to promote human health.

Throughout the world, economic policies have moved in the direction of liberalization since 1980, and international institutions (particularly Bretton Woods) have reflected this change in economic philosophy in their advocacy and lending policies. During the same period, the world has seen the fall of the Soviet bloc of centrally-managed economies and the pursuit of liberalization policies in China and India, the world’s two largest developing economies. These events continue to have a massive impact  on the structure of the world economy.

It was within this context that the World Trade Organization (WTO) was created in 1995 as a global body to promote liberalization of trade in goods and services. Of particular importance for our enquiry, the global application of minimum standards for intellectual property under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) has been the subject of controversy, particularly in regard to its potential impact on public health. As a result of this controversy, governments meeting at Doha in 2001 clarified some aspects of the relationship between the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health in the Declaration on the TRIPS agreement and public health.

        <h4>HEALTH, WEALTH AND POVERTY</h4>

        <p class="preview-text"> 

          The impact of these economic and political trends on global health is complex. While the relationship between poverty and globalization is beyond the scope of this report, evidence that correlates poverty with high disease burden is compelling and stands at the centre of the issues we are addressing. Poverty, disease burden and research capacity all intersect to create an array of challenges and opportunities for countries. Poverty affects purchasing power, and the inability of poor people to pay reduces effective demand, which in turn affects the degree of interest of for-profit companies.
          The complexity of factors that affect the ability of poor people to benefit from both the potential, and the actual, fruits of progress in health-related research should not be underestimated. By 2003, the number of people living in developing countries had grown to an estimated 5.3 billion – more than 80% of the total world population of nearly 6.3 billion (1). The World Bank categorizes developing countries as low or middle income countries, where (in 2004) low income countries had a per capita income of US$ 825 or less, lower middle income countries up to US$ 3255, and upper middle income countries up to US$ 10 065 (2). These are the definitions we use throughout this report. Within the category of developing countries, there is thus a wide spread (more than ten-fold) in average national incomes, while the degree of social and economic inequalities also varies widely within countries. This heterogeneity has important implications for our analysis, because not only do countries have different disease burdens, they also have widely varying resources and capacities to address them.

          </p>


        <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
        <p class="preview-text"> 
          As the report recognizes, patents are irrelevant for the development of the products needed to address the diseases prevailing in developing countries. Pharmaceutical companies decisively shape the global R&D agenda in this field and invest only where profitable markets exist. The extension of pharmaceutical patent protection to developing countries, mandated by the TRIPS Agreement, can do very little to prompt the development of such products, while it generates costs in terms of reduced access to the outputs of innovation. Where patents exist and are enforceable, medicines can be unaffordable for governments and patients in developing countries. This is why it is crucial to promote generics competition, which is essential to drive prices down and improve access to medicines to all, and to ensure a pro-competitive implementation of the TRIPS Agreement through the utilization, inter alia, of compulsory licences and government use provisions, when needed. Further analysis is required on the negative implications for public health of TRIPS-plus provisions (such as data exclusivity) contained in free trade agreements. WHO should continue to assess these developments and alert developing countries on their possible impact on public health.

          More analysis is also needed on the drastic decline in the capacity of the pharmaceutical industry to innovate, in spite of the availability of new powerful scientific and technological tools. Changes in the industry’s structure, the focus on highly profitable products and a relaxation of the requirements of patentability, contribute to explain the industry’s emphasis on the emulation or modification of existing products rather than on the development of genuinely new compounds. The report addresses but has not sufficiently elaborated on the profound distortions currently observed in the functioning of the patent system, which allows the proliferation of pharmaceutical patents on trivial developments that are used to obstruct generics competition.
