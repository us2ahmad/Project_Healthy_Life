         <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
         <p class="preview-text">
          This study examines the relative contributions of giving versus receiving support to longevity in a sample of older married adults. Baseline indicators of giving and receiving support were used to predict mortality status over a 5-year period in the Changing Lives of Older Couples sample. Results from logistic regression analyses indicated that mortality was signiﬁcantly reduced for individuals who reported providing instrumental support to friends, relatives, and neighbors, and individuals who reported providing emotional support to their spouse. Receiving support had no effect on mortality once giving support was taken into consideration. This pattern of ﬁndings was obtained after controlling for demographic, personality, health, mental health, and marital-relationship variables. These results have implications for un
          derstanding how social contact inﬂuences health and longevity.

         <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
         <p class="preview-text"> 
          As demographic shifts have produced a relatively more aged population, factors that inﬂuence longevity have taken on increased prominence. The documented health beneﬁts of social support may offer a promising avenue for reducing mortality among older adults. Indeed, there is a robust association between social contact and health and wellbeing (House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988). However, it is not clear that receiving support accounts for these beneﬁts (House et al., 1988). Tests of the social-support hypothesis—that receiving support improves health and well-being—have provided somewhat inconsistent results (Kahn, 1994), demonstrating in some instances that receiving support is harmful (e.g., S.L. Brown & Vinokur, in press; Hays, Saunders, Flint, Kaplan, & Blazer, 1997; Seeman, Bruce, & McAvay, 1996). In fact, a meta-analysis of the link between social support and health outcomes produced negligible ﬁndings, leading the study’s authors to conclude that the “small amounts of shared variance [between receiving support and health outcomes] may not be considered signiﬁcant nor generalizable” (Smith, Fernengel, Holcroft, Gerald, & Marien, 1994, p. 352).

        <h4>THE BENEFITS OF PROVIDING SUPPORT TO OTHERS</h4>

        <p class="preview-text"> 
          There are both theoretical and empirical reasons to hypothesize that giving support may promote longevity. For example, kin-selection theory (Hamilton, 1964a, 1964b) and reciprocal-altruism theory (Trivers, 1971) suggest that human reproductive success was contingent upon the ability to give resources to relationship partners. Social bonds (S.L. Brown, 1999) and emotional commitment (Nesse, 2001) have been theorized to promote high-cost giving. The resulting contribution made to relationship partners is theorized to trigger a desire for self-preservation on the part of the giver, enabling prolonged investment in kin (de Catanzaro, 1986) and reciprocal altruists. Although few studies have explicitly examined whether helping others increases longevity, sociologists note the ubiquity of giving to others (Rossi, 2001), and studies show that individuals derive beneﬁts from helping others, such as reduced distress (Cialdini, Darby, & Vincent, 1973; Midlarsky, 1991) and improved health (Schwartz & Sendor, 2000). Moreover, volunteering has beneﬁcial effects for volunteers, including improved physical and mental health (Omoto & Synder, 1995; Wilson & Musick, 1999). Even perceptions that are likely to be associated with giving, such as a sense of meaning, purpose, belonging, and mattering, have been shown to increase happiness and decrease depression (e.g., Taylor & Turner, 2000; see Batson, 1998, for a review).

        <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
        <p class="preview-text"> 
          Giving support may be an important component of interpersonal relationships that has considerable value to health and well-being. It may not be a coincidence that mortality and morbidity studies inadvertently assess giving or manipulate giving (e.g., taking care of a plant; Rodin & Langer, 1977) to operationalize variables of interest such as receiving social support or locus of control. If giving, rather than receiving, promotes longevity, then interventions that are currently designed to help people feel supported may need to be redesigned so that the emphasis is on what people do to help others. The possibility that giving support accounts for some of the beneﬁts of social contact is a new question that awaits future research
